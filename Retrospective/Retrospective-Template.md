=====================================

- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: **3/3** 
- Total points committed vs. done:  **12/12**
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): **3d 3h 30m / 5d 5h 45m**

#### Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| #0 | 4 | - | 3h | 5h 50m |
| 1     | 3 | 5 | 1d | 1d 5h |
| 2 | 4 | 5 | 1d | 1d 1h 55m |
| 3 | 4 | 2 | 1d 30m | 2d 1h |

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual): 

  Hours per task average:

  - **\~1h 50m (estimated)** 

  - **\~2h 22m (actual)**

  Standard deviation:

  - **1.22 (estimated)**

  - **1.61 (actual)** 

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  1 - (3d 3h 30m / 5d 5h 45m ) = 1 - 27.5/45.27 = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 = **40%**
  
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: **4** 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review: 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  

*We did not add specific tasks for Unit Testing, E2E testing and Code review because we thought it was included in the "To Verify" phase.*


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

  Errors in estimation were caused by lack of experience, misunderstanding of task planning phase and non optimal division of tasks.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

  - Initial planning needs more effort, especially in the setup and in the division of tasks, to be more efficient during the development
  - It's important to start setting up everything needed to work as soon as possible
  - To react positively to the organizational problems
  - Meeting both in person and in remote helps to work better
  - The organization of the demo requires more committment

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

​		-

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

​		-

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - **Immediate setup**: set up should be done at most in the first 2 days of sprint
  - **Better subdivision of the initial planning**: create cross-cutting tasks for initial planning, also including: GUI mockup, APIs definition (resources involved, URIs, requests and all the possible responses), test planning (which kind of tests to write, which libraries to use).
  - **Closer team meetings over time**: at the end of each team meeting, always define the date and time of the next one
  - **Better planning of the testing phase**: add tasks for Unit testing, E2E testing and code review 
  - **Organize the demo**: Add a task to work on the demo presentation
 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - We discussed the organizational problems from the start, in a constructive way 
  - We get along and we laugh a lot!
